---++ Usage
---+++ Hide
If you want to hide some text on you topic, enclose it with =<secret>= ... =</secret>=. When you press save, this gets pseudo-encrypted. It doesn't matter,
if your WYSIWYG editor mangles the bracket signs. %TOPIC% can handle that.

---+++ Unhide
Decrypt the text by adding the URL parameter =answer=42=. The topic content is not changed. The text is only decrypted for viewing.
